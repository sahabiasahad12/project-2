     	<h1>List of astronauts by name</h1>
     	<p>While the term astronaut is sometimes applied to anyone who trains for travel into space—including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists—this article lists only professional astronauts, those who have been selected to train professionally. This includes national space programs, industry and commercial space programs which train and/or hire their own professional astronauts.</p>
